# The Mirror Persona Building a Sock Puppet for Self-Study

## Overview
I wanted to learn how persuasive messages influence me. I ran a controlled exercise inside a lab I control. I used three public tools as inspiration only. I recorded reactions and deleted artifacts after the test.

## Persona design
I wrote a short personality brief. I listed name type, age range, occupation, interests, and motivation. I used fakenamegenerator.com for realistic name cues. I treated the generated profile as inspiration only.

## Face image
I generated a neutral, synthetic face for a mock profile. I made use of thispersondoesnotexist.com to generate an image of someone who does not exist and I kept the image in an isolated lab folder. I never published it.

## Lab email
I created a lab-only mailbox under my control. I used it only for this exercise. I deleted the mailbox after the test.

## Lab setup and safety controls
I set strict boundaries before sending any messages.

Scope: only my devices and my accounts.

Isolation: all puppet artifacts stayed inside a virtual machine.

No credential harvesting: I never collected real passwords.

No external distribution: I did not post the puppet to public sites.

## Information Gathering using Active Reconnaissance. 

I wanted to study how authoritative voice influences me. I designed a controlled, fictional exercise for a lab report. I used a fictional puppet to role play a conversation with my own account with the sole aim of making use of various social engineering tactics to acquire the target e-mail which will be the infrastructure for delivering a payload to the target. I noted feelings, tone, and outcomes. I began interacting with the target on a social media platform called instagram where I was able to acquire the target email address by impersonating a figure from a place of authority and portrayed myself as an Instagram support representative who is stepping in to assist the target in securing their account.


## Authorized lab phishing Excersise.

I was asked to design a controlled phishing exercise for our security training lab â€” a project that felt equal parts creative brief and ethical audit. From the start I made one thing non-negotiable: this would be an authorized, fully documented test with consent from the right stakeholders and safeguards to protect real user credentials. Below are the steps I made use of to craft a payload for my target.

Step 1: Launch the setoolkit tool on Kali VM.

Step 2: Select the type of attack. In this case, the option number 1, since we're launching a social engineering 

attack.

Step 3: Select the form of attack, in this case, the website attack vector tool which allows me to clone or script a website.

Step 4: Select the mode you intend making use of to harvest credentials. In our case, the credential harvester attack method.

Step 5: Select the Method you intend making use of to harvest Credentials, In this case, the Site Cloner option.

Step 6: Paste the target's url website and proceed with clone.
