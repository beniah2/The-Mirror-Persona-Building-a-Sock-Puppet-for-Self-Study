# The Mirror Persona Building a Sock Puppet for Self-Study

## Overview
I wanted to learn how persuasive messages influence me. I ran a controlled exercise inside a lab I control. I used three public tools as inspiration only. I recorded reactions and deleted artifacts after the test.

## Persona design
I wrote a short personality brief. I listed name type, age range, occupation, interests, and motivation. I used fakenamegenerator.com for realistic name cues. I treated the generated profile as inspiration only.

## Face image
I generated a neutral, synthetic face for a mock profile. I made use of thispersondoesnotexist.com to generate an image of someone who does not exist and I kept the image in an isolated lab folder. I never published it.

## Lab email
I created a lab-only mailbox under my control. I used it only for this exercise. I deleted the mailbox after the test.

## Lab setup and safety controls
I set strict boundaries before sending any messages.

Scope: only my devices and my accounts.

Isolation: all puppet artifacts stayed inside a virtual machine.

No credential harvesting: I never collected real passwords.

No external distribution: I did not post the puppet to public sites.

## Information Gathering using Active Reconnaissance. 

I wanted to study how authoritative voice influences me. I designed a controlled, fictional exercise for a lab report. I used a fictional puppet to role play a conversation with my own account with the sole aim of making use of various social engineering tactics to acquire the target e-mail which will be the infrastructure for delivering a payload to the target. I noted feelings, tone, and outcomes. I began interacting with the target on a social media platform called instagram where I was able to acquire the target email address by impersonating a figure from a place of authority and portrayed myself as an Instagram support representative who is stepping in to assist the target in securing their account.


## Authorized lab phishing Excersise.

I was asked to design a controlled phishing exercise for our security training lab — a project that felt equal parts creative brief and ethical audit. From the start I made one thing non-negotiable: this would be an authorized, fully documented test with consent from the right stakeholders and safeguards to protect real user credentials. Below are the steps I made use of to craft a payload for my target.

Step 1: Launch the setoolkit tool on Kali VM.

Step 2: Select the type of attack. In this case, the option number 1, since we're launching a social engineering 

attack.

Step 3: Select the form of attack, in this case, the website attack vector tool which allows me to clone or script a website.

Step 4: Select the mode you intend making use of to harvest credentials. In our case, the credential harvester attack method.

Step 5: Select the Method you intend making use of to harvest Credentials, In this case, the Site Cloner option.

Step 6: Paste the target's url website and proceed with clone.

## Testing the Attack

 In this stage, the target is prompted to interact with the cloned website in order to mimic a response.  I accomplished this by using the previously constructed sock puppet email address to send an email to my target containing a phishing link, posing as an Instagram support person, in the hopes that the target would interact with the cloned website.

## Mitigation Techniques

I include defensive steps I used or recommend. These steps protect individuals and organizations. The following are defensive steps to safeguard against phishing;

1. Pause for 30 seconds before clicking any unexpected link.

2. Read the sender address, not just the display name. Check the full domain.

3. Hover over links to preview the URL before clicking. If a preview is unavailable, do not click.

4. Never enter credentials on a site I reached from an unexpected email. Always go to the site by typing the known URL.

5. Use a password manager so I do not type passwords into random sites. The manager fills only recognized domains.

6. Enable multi-factor authentication for every account that supports it.


## Final note

This account is a safe, ethical narrative of how I built a lab-only sock puppet for self-study. The story names the tools I used for inspiration. It focuses on learning, measurement, and mitigation.
